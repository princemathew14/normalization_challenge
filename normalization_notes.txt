Normalization Process for Library Database

1) Original Design:
One large table with book and author details:
- Redundant author data (name/email repeated for every book)
- Difficult to update and prone to anomalies

2)Normalization Steps:
1NF:
- Ensured atomic values (e.g., no arrays or grouped data)

2NF:
- Separated author info into its own table to eliminate partial dependencies

3NF:
- Ensured all non-key fields depend only on primary keys (removed transitive dependencies)

3)Categories (Many-to-Many):
Books can belong to multiple categories and vice versa.
- Introduced `categories` table for category names
- Introduced `book_categories` join table to model many-to-many relationships between books and categories

This structure avoids redundancy and improves scalability.
